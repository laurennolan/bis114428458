<h1>Coeliac Disease - Eating Out Card</h1>
<p>I have Coeliac Disease and cannot eat food or drink that contains gluten. I must stick to a gluten-free diet. I cannot eat Wheat, Barley, Oats, Rye and Spelt. Gluten is also used in many processed foods.</p>
<p>
    Please check ingredients for:
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
      <li>Noodles</li>
      <li>Couscous</li>
      <li>Soya Sauce</li>
      <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>Pasta</li>
      <li>Beers, Stouts, Lagers</li>
      <li>Baking Powder</li>
      <li>Farina</li>
      <li>Semolina</li>
      <li>Malt</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    I can't eat any foods that have been deep fried in or flavoured with any ingredients containing gluten, e.g. battered fish and chips or gravies.
    
</p>
<p>
    Please ensure my food does not come into contact with any food containing gluten or utensils or work surfaces that have been used to prepare meals with gluten.

</p>

    THANK YOU
